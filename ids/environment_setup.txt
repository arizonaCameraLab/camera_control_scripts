Totally follow IDS's official instruction: https://www.ids-imaging.us/files/downloads/ids-software-suite/readme/readme-ids-software-suite-linux-4.95.2_EN.html

1. Install dependency
sudo apt-get install debconf libc6 libomp5 libstdc++6 libqt5core5a libqt5xml5 libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5 libqt5concurrent5 libqt5opengl5 libcap2 libusb-1.0-0 cmake gtk2-engines-pixbuf

2. Install IDS Software Suite
Unzip the tgz file downloaded, get a bunch of ueye*.deb files. Install them all.# navigate to the unzipped .deb files
sudo dpkg -i ueye-common*.deb #needs to be installed first
sudo dpkg -i ueye*.deb #should exclude ueye-common

3. Start camera daemon
sudo systemctl start ueyeethdrc #might not that useful
sudo systemctl start ueyeusbdrc

Now connect USB camera. The camera's instruction LED should be green instead of red. Open the GUI application, IDS Camera Manager to check whether the program is working normally.

4. Install pyueye package
pip3 install pyueye

5. Install opencv
pip3 install opencv-python (already installed)
